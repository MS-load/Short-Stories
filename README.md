# Short-Stories

Short-stories is a space which connects authors with readers. Any new visitor is treated as a guest who is free to read all posted stories. To become an author, one needs to register and login. Do note - we have a strict admin system with the absolute right to moderate content.

# Information

For the Front-End part we used [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) and [Bootsrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).

For the Back-End we used [Cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors), [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express), [JSON-Webtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken) and lastly [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose).

# Installation

You need to do npm i first in Short-Stories folder(treated as the server) and then you need to do cd client and then npm i again.

# Run-App

You need to start the client and the server separately. You can do that with the 'npm start' command first in Short-Stories to start the server and then cd into client folder and 'npm start' again.

# Testing

A few users for testing:

    email: aa@test.com  password: aa

    email: bb@test.com  password: bb

If you want to use the admin-user email: 

    admin@root.com  password: admin123

Our token is valid for 3h, if you want to test it you can change the expiration time to see how the backend and the frontend responds.
